# Testing Mobile App

## Running Development Server

To test mobile app with real-time debugging:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm start
```

**Important**: Run `npm start` in **foreground** (without `&` or background flags) so console logs are directly visible for debugging. This allows you to see:
- App startup logs
- Error messages 
- Voice module initialization
- Permission requests
- Real-time debugging output


In PowerShell, avoid using `&&` syntax - run commands separately.
